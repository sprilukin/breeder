usage: spawn <command> [<args>]

where `<command>` is any command and `<args>` it's arguments.

NOTE:
    that only single command with it's arguments is allowed,
    you can not use *shell* features like `&&` or `|`

example:
assuming you have the following folders structure:

/folder
  |-/project1 //git-based project
  |-/project2 //also git-based project


Lets say you want to call `git fetch` in both project1 and project2 folders
You can achieve this by calling the following command:

cd /folder
spawn git fetch

git fetch will be spawned and executed in parallel in all folders under current working folder.
