# spawn-lord
Command line utility for hipsters ðŸ‘“ which helps to automate parallel execution of same command in different folders 

## Installation
`npm install -g spawn-lord`

## Usage 
`spawn <command>`

where `<command>` is any command with it's params.

**NOTE** that only single command with params is allowed, you can not use *shell* features like `&&` or `|`

 
## Example
assuming you have the following folders structure:

```
/folder
  |-/project1 //git-based project
  |-/project2 //also git-based project
```

Lets say you want to call `git fetch` in both **project1** and **project2**.
You can achieve this by calling the following command:

```sh
cd /folder
spawn git fetch
```

`git fetch` will be spawned and executed in parallel in all folders under current working folder:

## Alternatives

- [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
- `find . -name .git -type d -execdir git fetch ';'` although it executes command serially
